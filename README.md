[Simple Personal Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QTW4JKaCZk&ab_channel=AlexandraLewis)


This is part cv, part personal website, part fangirl art piece. 

I have included 4 HTML pages (home page, about, follow, skillz) and corresponding css files for each page. 3 of the 4 css files have an accompanying scss file.
